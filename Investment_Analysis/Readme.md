The objective of this project is to understand the global trends in investments so as to make the investment decisions more effective.

Constraints adhered in the project:
1.	Investment range: 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
2.	Investing only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in
•	For the analysis, a country is considered to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country
Strategy: invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early-stage startup investors.
Goals of data analysis: The goals are divided into three sub-goals:
•	Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.
•	Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Funds’ favourites as well.
•	Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight 'main sectors' provided in the mapping file. The two files — companies and rounds2 — have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.)
